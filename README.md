## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
During the development of this project, I faced the challenge of identifying syntax errors in HTML. Usually, when I'm coding, I would have an IDE checking my syntax errors so that my program ran nicely. Additionally, even if the IDE didn't catch an error and instead the compiler throws an error, I would be able to quickly identify where the program went wrong. However, when I was coding with HTML and Javascript, I quickly realized how easy it is to make mistakes and have a program run. For example, when I was coding the start and stop buttons in HTML, I misspelled onclick with onlik and this caused an issue as the game didn't start. When I encountered this problem, I thought the issue was in the function name in Javascript, so I copied and pasted the function name in HTML. This didn't work and confused me and so I spent an hour trying to debug it. Eventually, I decided to check the HTML syntax and noticed the misspelling of onclick. After that problem, I realized how I was too dependent on an IDE in checking syntax errors. From then on, I would carefully check my syntax in my program and started to develop my debugging skills.
